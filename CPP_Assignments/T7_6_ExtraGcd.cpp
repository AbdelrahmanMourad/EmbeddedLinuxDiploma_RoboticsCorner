    Task(7.6):
    ----------
       Write a C++ function that find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers.abort

       The greatest common dvisor (GCD), also called the greatest common factor, of two numbers
        is the largest number that divides them both.For instance, the greatest common factor 
        of 20 and 15 is 5, since 5 divides both 20 and 15 and no larger number has this property.

    Example:
        Sample Output:
            Input the first number: 25
            Input the second number: 15
            The Greatest Common Divisor is: 5
