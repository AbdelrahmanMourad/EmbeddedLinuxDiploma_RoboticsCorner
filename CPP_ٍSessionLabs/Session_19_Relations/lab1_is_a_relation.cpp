|   OOP Relationships: Summary & Examples
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1. "Is-a" (Inheritance):
|    - Expresses specialization/generalization.
|    - Implemented via class inheritance.
|    - Example: class Dog : public Animal {};
|
| 2. "Has-a" (Composition/Aggregation):
|    - Expresses whole-part relationship.
|    - Composition: Strong ownership (part cannot exist without whole).
|    - Aggregation: Weak ownership (part can exist independently).
|    - Example (Composition): class Car { Engine engine; };
|    - Example (Aggregation): class Team { std::vector<Player*> players; };
|
| 3. "Uses-a" (Association/Dependency):
|    - Expresses that a class uses another class temporarily.
|    - Implemented by passing objects as parameters or using them locally.
|    - Example: class Doctor { void CheckPatient(Stethoscope& s); };
|
| 4. "Part-of" (Aggregation vs. Composition):
|    - Aggregation: "Has-a" with independent lifetime.
|    - Composition: "Has-a" with dependent lifetime.
|
| 5. UML Notation:
|    - Inheritance: solid line with closed arrow.
|    - Composition: solid diamond.
|    - Aggregation: hollow diamond.
|    - Association: solid line.

|   50 Interview Questions & Answers on OOP Relationships
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 1.  Q: What is an "is-a" relationship in OOP?
|     A: It represents inheritance, where one class is a specialized type of another.
| 2.  Q: What is a "has-a" relationship?
|     A: It represents composition or aggregation, where one class contains another as a part.
| 3.  Q: What is a "uses-a" relationship?
|     A: It represents association or dependency, where one class uses another to perform a task.
| 4.  Q: How is inheritance implemented in C++?
|     A: Using the ':' syntax, e.g., class Sub : public Super {}.
| 5.  Q: What is composition?
|     A: A strong "has-a" relationship where the part cannot exist without the whole.
| 6.  Q: What is aggregation?
|     A: A weak "has-a" relationship where the part can exist independently of the whole.
| 7.  Q: Give an example of composition in C++.
|     A: class Car { Engine engine; };
| 8.  Q: Give an example of aggregation in C++.
|     A: class Team { std::vector<Player*> players; };
| 9.  Q: How is association different from aggregation?
|     A: Association is a general relationship; aggregation is a specific type of association with ownership semantics.
| 10. Q: What is dependency in OOP?
|     A: When one class depends on another to function, usually by using it as a parameter or local variable.
| 11. Q: What keyword is used for inheritance in C++?
|     A: public, protected, or private after the colon.
| 12. Q: Can a class inherit from multiple classes in C++?
|     A: Yes, C++ supports multiple inheritance.
| 13. Q: What is the base class?
|     A: The class being inherited from.
| 14. Q: What is the derived class?
|     A: The class that inherits from the base class.
| 15. Q: What is method overriding?
|     A: Redefining a base class method in the derived class.
| 16. Q: What is the purpose of 'virtual' keyword?
|     A: To allow derived classes to override base class methods for polymorphism.
| 17. Q: What is upcasting?
|     A: Treating a derived class object as a base class object.
| 18. Q: What is downcasting?
|     A: Casting a base class pointer/reference to a derived class type.
| 19. Q: What is the diamond problem?
|     A: Ambiguity caused by multiple inheritance when two base classes inherit from the same ancestor.
| 20. Q: How is the diamond problem solved in C++?
|     A: Using virtual inheritance.
| 21. Q: How do you implement composition in C++?
|     A: By including an object as a member variable.
| 22. Q: How do you implement aggregation in C++?
|     A: By including a pointer or reference to another object.
| 23. Q: What happens to composed objects when the container is destroyed?
|     A: They are destroyed as well.
| 24. Q: What happens to aggregated objects when the container is destroyed?
|     A: They are not destroyed; they can exist independently.
| 25. Q: Give a real-world example of composition.
|     A: A House has Rooms.
| 26. Q: Give a real-world example of aggregation.
|     A: A Team has Players who can exist outside the team.
| 27. Q: Can you have both composition and aggregation in the same class?
|     A: Yes.
| 28. Q: What is the difference between strong and weak ownership?
|     A: Strong ownership (composition) means the part cannot exist without the whole; weak ownership (aggregation) means it can.
| 29. Q: How does C++ manage memory for composition?
|     A: Automatically, as part of the containing object.
| 30. Q: How does C++ manage memory for aggregation?
|     A: The programmer must manage the lifetime of aggregated objects.
| 31. Q: How is association implemented in C++?
|     A: By passing objects as parameters or storing references/pointers.
| 32. Q: What is a unidirectional association?
|     A: Only one class knows about the other.
| 33. Q: What is a bidirectional association?
|     A: Both classes know about each other.
| 34. Q: Give an example of dependency in C++.
|     A: void Print(Document& doc); â€” Print depends on Document.
| 35. Q: Is association always permanent?
|     A: No, it can be temporary (method parameter) or permanent (member variable).
| 36. Q: What is the difference between association and dependency?
|     A: Dependency is a special case of association, usually temporary.
| 37. Q: Can association exist without inheritance?
|     A: Yes.
| 38. Q: Can a class have multiple associations?
|     A: Yes.
| 39. Q: What is multiplicity in association?
|     A: The number of objects involved in the relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.).
| 40. Q: How is multiplicity represented in C++?
|     A: Using containers like std::vector for one-to-many.
| 41. Q: How are OOP relationships represented in UML?
|     A: Inheritance: solid line with closed arrow; Composition: solid diamond; Aggregation: hollow diamond; Association: solid line.
| 42. Q: What is a dependency arrow in UML?
|     A: A dashed arrow showing that one class depends on another.
| 43. Q: Can a class be part of multiple relationships?
|     A: Yes.
| 44. Q: What is a reflexive association?
|     A: A class associated with itself.
| 45. Q: What is a qualified association?
|     A: An association with a qualifier (like a key or index).
| 46. Q: What is a navigability in association?
|     A: Indicates which direction the association can be traversed.
| 47. Q: What is a composite aggregation?
|     A: Another term for composition.
| 48. Q: What is the main benefit of using composition over inheritance?
|     A: Greater flexibility and less coupling.
| 49. Q: When should you use inheritance?
|     A: When there is a clear "is-a" relationship and shared behavior.
| 50. Q: When should you use composition?
|     A: When you want to build complex types from simpler ones and allow for more flexible designs.
