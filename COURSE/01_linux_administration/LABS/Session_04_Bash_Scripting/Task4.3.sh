# Reminder is very useful in programming, For example, an even number % 2
#     is always 0 and an odd number % 2 is always 1.
#     So you can use this property to determine whether a number is even or odd.
# 
# Suppose today is Saturday and you and your friends are going to meet in 10 days. 
#     what day is in 10 days? you can find that day is Tuesday using the
#     following equation.
# 
# 
# _____________________________
# |                           |
# |   (6 + 10) % 7    is  2   |
# |___________________________|
# 
#   -   Saturday is the 6th day in a week
#   -   After 10 days
#   -   A week has 7 days
#   -   The 2nd day in a week is Tuesday
